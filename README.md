# Pathfinder++
Pathfinder was a school project I worked on with a friend several months ago, and I decided to improve it a bit. The programming level wasn't that high, so the unchanged code can still be a bit ugly.

# Building Pf++ using CMake
Make sure you have static SFML 2.3+ and static SFGUI 0.3+ installed. CMake should be able to find them (use SFML_ROOT and SFGUI_ROOT variables if needed)

Run CMake in the main directory, then build the app with your favourite make program. Voil√†.
